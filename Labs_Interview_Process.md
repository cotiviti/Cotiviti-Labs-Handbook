# How we interview
This document describes the Cotiviti Labs interview process. We have extremely high standards and finding world class candidates that meet or exceed those standards can be difficult.  We have refined this interview process many times over the years and expect to refine it more as time progresses.

## Online Testing
The interview process for Labs typically starts out with an online test of some kind if possible. We look for candidates that are in the top 5%.  So, for example, if we have an online test for a caniddate then we look for candidates that score 95% or greater. We may consider candidates in the top 10% if they bring some unique valuable skill that will enhance the team. This will typically screen out candidates that would not interview well.  Example tests include those from Codility -

* [Cotiviti Java Developer - Basic](https://app.codility.com/public-link/Cotiviti-Labs-Java-Developer)
* [Cotiviti Java Developer - Advanced](https://app.codility.com/public-link/Cotiviti-Labs-Java-developer/)
* [Cotiviti Full Stack Developer](https://app.codility.com/public-link/Cotiviti-Full-Stack-Developer-with-TypescriptJavascriptScalaJava-Focus)
* [Cotiviti Scala Developer](https://app.codility.com/public-link/Cotiviti-Scala-Test/)
* [Cotiviti Python Develop](https://app.codility.com/public-link/Cotiviti-Cotiviti-Python-Developer---Baseline/)

We have discovered that this is the single greatest indicator of a great candidate.  If they take the time to try out our test they are clearly interested and not just shopping.  If they pass the test then they clearly have the ability to write great code in a short time for a problem they just encountered.

## The Phone Screen
Once we identify a potentially viable candidate our recruiting team will screen the candidate.  They will gather basic information like salary expectations, job requirements, career aspirations, etc.  If the candidate appears to be interesting, we will share the [Labs Handbook](https://github.com/cotiviti/Cotiviti-Labs-Handbook/blob/master/README.md) with them.  We have found that candidates that interview well with us will read it completely and will be eager to join our team.  Candidates that do not read this handbook or read it and are put off by it will not interview well with us.

If the screening goes well then we will schedule a series of interviews with the candidate. This can be a very stressful time for the candidate so we should do everything we can to put them at ease so that we get a fair assessment of them as they will be should they hire on. To this end we like to be very transparent with them about the process, sharing the interview schedule with them and helping them prepare as best we can.  We also need this process to move quickly to reduce candidate angst, ideally concluding in a single day if the candidate's schedule can accommodate it.

## The Interviews
We interview in teams of two so that we always have two opinions on how an interview went. The interview teams are:
* Development Operations (two DevOps) - When interviewing developers, our focus of this interview is on the candidate's sensitivity to the operational implications of their decisions.  Many developers are prone to whipping up a solution that demo well but present an operational nightmare.  We are looking for developers who will partner with development operations to produce solutions that are easy to operate.  For development operations candidates, our focus is on their ability and willingness to automate instead of administering. Administrators may be able to solve problems one time, but we are looking for people that will automate the problem so that they never have to do it again.
* Application Development (two developers) - When interviewing developers, our focus in this interview is on the candidate's ability to code up a solution to a problem live.  For development operations candidates, we are looking for their ability to code up a solution to an infrastructure challenge in AWS, Azure, or GCE. This enables us to watch them go through their thought processes in real time.
* Customer fit (two solution owners) - Our focus in this interview is to evaluate a candidate's ability to work with our operations partners. Because we run multi-disciplinary teams, it is critical for us to evaluate each candidate's ability to work with our partners in operations.  Arrogance and egotism are red flags that often arise when talking with a business person who is not technical.
* Cultural fit (one person from Human Resources) - Our focus in this interview is for Human Resources to interview candidates for team and company culture fit.
* Coach interview (Coach) - This interview should always go last.  This is an opportunity for the candidate to interview one of our coaches.  This is an unusual turn of events for most candidates who do not expect an opportunity for them to turn the tables.  Because this can be surprising, we remind them ahead of this interview that they will be in the interview seat.  We use the candidates questions as a way for us to further evaluate them as well as giving the candidate an opportunity to evaluate us as a company. 

Our recruiting team will schedule each interview and include the team calendar (cotiviti.labs@gmail.com) so that the entire team can see the interview schedule.

Each interview will typically be one hour and will focus on questions relevant to the topic.  This is true for all candidates including development operation candidates, developers, and clinical policy developers.

Each interview team will fill out our [candidate survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PSGW5YP) **immediately** following the interview. The recruiting team should schedule an additional 15 minutes at the end of each interview to give the interview team time to fill out the survey. In total, each interview will take 75 minutes - one hour for the interview and 15 minutes for the survey.

After their last interview with the Labs team coach, we give the candidate the opportunity to fill out the same survey the team filled out.  This gives the candidate an opportunity to provide their closing argument on why they would be a good addition to the team.  Note that if we hire the candidate then we will provide the survey results to them as their first 360 input in to our coaching process.  This, too, can be a bit surprising to the candidate.  Many times, they think they have been given access to something they shouldn't have. We should notify them ahead of time that this step is as designed.

At any time, an interview team can stop the interview process by signaling that we should not hire a person. This will save the candidate time and the time of the interview team.

## Wrap Up

We will only make an offer to candidates that have clear cut survey results.  If more than one person indicated that we should probably not hire a candidate, then we will not extend them an offer.  If one person indicated that we should not hire the candidate, we will arrange a meeting with that person to discuss.
