# Cotiviti Labs Team Handbook

*“Servants to the Mission”*

## Introduction

If you are new to the Cotiviti Labs team and reading this for the first time then welcome! We are terribly excited that you joined! Getting here was no easy process. It wasn’t just the interviews and exams you went through for us; it was the years of school, the many hours learning your craft, and your family’s blank stare when you tried to explain to them what you do. After all that, we wanted to make your introduction into our team as painless as possible, so we wrote this handbook for you.

This handbook will walk you through our thinking about culture and why it is so important to our team. Culture is our operating system and we mean this in a very concrete way. We think of our culture as code. This is code that you can fork, and code that you can modify. If you see a way to improve our operating system then submit an issue and we will review it as a team and update our operating system accordingly. Understanding this operating system is one of the most important things you will do in your first few days to secure your success and ours.

### Our Mission

The stated mission for Cotiviti is to unlock value through insights. Cotiviti is in a unique position because we have access to huge volumes of health care and retail data. The Cotiviti Labs mission is to support and enable the Company mission. Our particular take, however, is two parts:

1. The first part of our mission is to help our customers find new ways of leveraging that data to bring about positive change in the health care market. This change could be removing inefficiency from the health care market, bringing about positive changes in health care outcomes, or identifying fraud, waste, & abuse. We do this by identifying powerful intersections of technology and opportunities.

2. The second part of our mission is, arguably, even more important: cultivating a culture that affords the greatest amount of creative latitude to great people who are passionate about creating amazing things so that we can see novel ways to bring our clients new insights.

### What is Culture

Culture is perhaps the most important contributing factor to achieving great things. Culture can create a foundation of trust that enables societies and companies to move quickly when they have a sense of purpose. When you have an understanding of the values of those around you there doesn't need to be a debate about a great many things. Countries will often put these values on paper in a constitution or other founding documents, which enables their citizens to work together and get on with ventures like launching rovers to mars. Culture can also be the single biggest contributing factor to the destruction of great things or preventing great things from happening.

So let's start with basics: what is culture? For our purposes we define culture as how people behave without having to refer to a handbook like this one! We learn it as children. Teachers reinforce culture from a very early age. Governments legislate culture to protect it. By the time we are adults our culture defines a significant portion of who we are. It is those behaviors that we exhibit almost instinctively and without thinking.

For example, American culture includes holding the door open for the person behind you. Swiss culture includes not scraping the bottom of the fondue pot with your fork. Indian culture includes taking your shoes off before entering someone's home. These and countless other things define each culture. Many cultural characteristics have perfectly reasonable explanations that, once explained by someone from that culture, make perfect sense. For example, US politeness comes from a long tradition of immigrants trying to get along with one another without a common language. Not scraping the bottom of a fondue pot in Switzerland preserves the delicate enamel coating the pot. Taking your shoes off in India prevents the dust and grime of the streets from entering the home. One of the best things about being part of an international team is learning about such cultural practices and co-opting them for your own benefit. Then there are more universal practices like the European tradition of looking one another in the eyes while making a toast or avoiding your handset when amongst friends. These cultural traditions also make sense in that they bring us closer together as people.  

But, there are also some cultural behaviors that make no sense or, worst case, cause harm. To take a rather innocuous example, consider the widespread cultural practice of saying, "bless you," when someone sneezes. Why do so many people do this? Where does it come from? It certainly seems well intentioned. But does it make sense like the other practices highlighted above? [Pope Gregory I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_bless_you)  introduced this cultural practice in the belief that a sneeze was an early indication of the plague. Now we know better. Yet while the context has changed, this cultural characteristic persists. It would not take anyone very long to enumerate a long list of cultural behaviors related to gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and skin color that are less innocuous than saying "bless you" when someone sneezes.

But cultures do change and many cultural practices that may be damaging to some, fortunately, often melt away with enlightenment. In other words, as the times change, so do we. As we become more interconnected and learn about the attractive characteristics of other cultures we incorporate them in to our own. As we learn about each other through our increasingly interconnected world, things that may have been scary become familiar, comfortable, and potentially make for better societies. But these conversations about cultural behaviors are typically organic, not actively managed, and occur only when some negatively impacted group gains enough acceptance that they can lobby for change.

Companies have cultures, too. Those cultures can also be incredibly productive or incredibly damaging.  There are a number of outstanding books, articles, and blogs that talk about fascinating company cultures and provide valuable insights that can help any career. This is not one of those treatments, though we mention a few in the Acknowledgements section at the end. This handbook is about **our** culture and creating an active conversation about how we can improve it to improve our spirit as a team and produce greater value for our customers, our investors, and ourselves.

### Positional Power

Culture for most companies emerges from those individuals who are anointed with positional power at influential points in a managerial hierarchy. So, in a very real sense, the culture at most companies is often a form of personality cult. This point is not intended to be negative, so let’s put those thoughts aside for the moment. Instead, think Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or Larry Ellison. These giants embody the culture of their companies and they exert unshakable positional power over their direct reports to achieve amazing things with incredible efficiency.

Such giants forge a culture that mirrors their beliefs through hiring and firing, sometimes documented and sometimes not. Individuals drawn to the personality will apply for jobs. Those repelled by the personality will look elsewhere. Through a process of natural selection a culture emerges that is an extension of the individuals with the greatest positional power. When those with positional power are agents for good, this approach is very efficient in producing results. Decisions come quickly, corporate mistakes have clear lines of accountability, and investors can count on the consistency of the products that emanate from the single vision of the person at the top.

This model is a distant echo of monarchies from our past that have driven civilizations for thousands of years. A quick tour of almost any European or Asian countryside will bring this analogy into sharp focus. Many kings and queens brought stability, safety, and progress to their realm. Societies under benevolent rule benefitted from incredible works of engineering, art, and research. The Roman and Ottoman Empires expanded on this monarchy model by implementing a military hierarchy that enabled emperors to rule over vast expanses of land and peoples.

Of course, such models can also suffer from the instability brought by mortality, both real and metaphoric. Kings and queens die. CEO's age and retire. Charismatic leaders receive offers they cannot refuse. When such eventualities happen, new kings are coroneted, new CEO's are hired, and new charismatic leaders ascend. Then the uncertainty begins. Suddenly a new personality cult must form around the new leader. Courtesans (aka, direct reports) jockey for favor with the new king or queen in the murky waters of the emerging court. What cultural beliefs will they bring? What advisors will the new leader bring to the fray to counsel them? What territorial recalibrations will they implement to reflect their belief system and how will it differ from what came before?

Of course, history tells of countless examples of populations whipsawed by war, death, and the rare instances where a ruler renounced the throne. Occasionally everything turns out okay. However, most of the time there is a period of instability, sometimes quite severe, until the new leader proves to be benevolent or a competitor wrests control away from a tyrant weakened by their misdeeds. Now think about a corporate analog.

Steve Jobs is perhaps the most well documented example in recent years. When Jobs tragically passed away, Apple's stock price dropped precipitously and many thought that the creative flame at Apple had flickered out, leaving a thin trail of smoke that will always remind us of, and inspire us by, Jobs’ undeniable brilliance. The same thing happened at the Disney animation studio when Walt Disney passed away. In place of these giants rose individuals who saw their mission as creating a sustainable culture that could outlast the founders. Ed Catmull, a big influence on our own culture, says in his book "Creativity, Inc." that this was his primary mission for most of his time at Pixar and later Disney Studios—for the culture to outlast the founders. This is our goal as well.

A culture that outlasts the founders is something in which investors can invest with confidence and customers can look to for assurance. Good investors will always invest in “the team,” but by making culture a first class characteristic of a company they can invest in something more durable. If the culture is vibrant and able to churn out customer value, then when key people leave, the culture will endure.

Admittedly, the Cotiviti Labs culture is still young. The annealing process is still underway. We look to you, the reader, to be the champion of our culture. All candidates receive a copy of this handbook. You joined us with your eyes wide open knowing that this is the way we operate.  Now we look to you to fight for it and never take it for granted.

### So, what is our culture?

We take our cultural inspiration from companies like Pixar, Valve, Netflix, and GitHub. These companies explicitly define and crowd-source their culture. They have designed their cultures to do everything possible to attract, keep, and energize top talent to maximize customer value. These are primary goals for the Cotiviti Labs culture as well. Here are a few other characteristics of the Cotiviti Labs culture “elevator pitch” that you can use with friends and family:

1. The most notable feature is that we have a flat, networked organization that provides all available talent with the maximum number of avenues to deliver value.

2. Our culture values diversity of opinions, genders, ages, ethnicities, localities, and differences of all kinds. Such diversity often generates more creativity and science agrees with fascinating studies like [this one](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) and [this one](http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity). To this end we actively work bolster our culture to support diversity. A command and control model doesn't work very well for creative work in general and not at all when someone's manager is 14,000 kilometers away; hence our flat organization.

3. One implication of this level of diversity is that the best people come from all over the world and are not always willing to move to a new place or stay in just one place. This implies that we must value a model that enables people to work from wherever they choose but still feel like they are part of our tribe. To support our global innovation model we make aggressive use of collaboration technologies but also have locations where some or all of us can come together to brainstorm, so we try to get together several times a year.

4. Great managers bring many years of experience. They clear hurdles out of the way. They do everything they can to create an inspiring and innovative culture, and then get out of the way. Bad managers are the pointy haired types who exert stifling positional power by micro-managing their employees into oblivion from a position of ignorance. We decided to keep the good parts and remove the bad parts. We do this in part by hiring “Coaches.” Coaches have decades of experience, are seen as leaders in their field, and are mentors capable of facilitating creative conversations to a productive conclusion. They do not assign work or do reviews but they are an awesome resource when you need them.

We take these characteristics and mix them with the best of the broader Cotiviti culture to create the Cotiviti Labs culture.

### Our History

We started the Cotiviti Labs team in the summer of 2014 in response to a challenge from our Chief Operating Officer at the time, Dave Beaulieu. His challenge - deliver a 10X productivity improvement.  This was, and remains, an incredibly aggressive challenge.  To achieve something like this would require a completely new way of thinking, new technologies, new processes, new people, and a new culture. Our Chief Executive Officer, Doug Williams, is fond of saying that we must "create our most fierce competitor so that the market doesn't do it for us."  So, we decided to build the team and the culture around a next generation payment policy accuracy solution that could level up the entire company and be that most fierce competitor.

Unique to this team from the very beginning was a charter to create a unique culture designed to attract, retain, and energize excellent talent capable of delivering a 10X productivity improvement. This charter drove the construction of this handbook, our hiring practices, and even our technology stack. Simply put, we believe that the highest quality, most creative products and ideas come from great people. Attracting, retaining, and energizing these people requires a specific kind of culture that provides each individual the creative freedom to achieve amazing things while also providing them with world-class mentoring so they can achieve even greater things. We believe that we are all capable of learning and growing no matter where we are in our careers, and we can learn from others no matter where they are in their careers.

## Culture as code

For any research and development team responsible for producing production ready solutions, tactical and strategic speed is our primary currency with customers and sponsors. Tactically we must move quickly to deliver production value even if it is point-in-time value without any tie to a strategic outcome (though this is not our preference). Our preference is to move quickly delivering interim value that aligns strategically with a much larger picture.

The primary reason we wrote this handbook is that we believe that culture is an accelerant. Culture helps people move quickly through chartered and unchartered waters. Culture helps you make decisions quickly without having to talk or think things through.

If we think of culture as our operating system, it only makes sense that we describe it explicitly. Many companies do this. Go to one of these companies and you will see a copy of such a book, typically written by or about the company founder. While we applaud these efforts, it unwittingly produces a stifling effect. The book itself becomes a form of positional power, almost a metaphoric bible that people use to whip wayward employees into shape even when the culture has ossified and lost relevance.

Therefore, the last reason we wrote this handbook is that we want you to treat it as code. We want you to fork it, change it, and refactor it. In short, we want you to put as much energy into helping us keep our culture vibrant and relevant as we put into refactoring and architecting software that delivers world-class solutions that amaze our customers.

### The Cultural Bank Account

We think of culture execution as a bank account. In 2015 we heard this metaphor at the Web Summit conference in Ireland and we like it quite a lot. In short,

1. There are things you can do to strengthen our culture, increasing our balance.
2. There are also things you can do to weaken it, decreasing our balance.

For example, let us say we find a candidate who just exudes our cultural values without ever having read our handbook. Hiring this person will naturally strengthen the culture because that individual will live those values because that is simply who they are. This new person helps our cultural bank account balance go up!

Alternatively, let us say one of our team members is actively undermining our cultural values and we choose to ignore their behavior because we just are not up for that candid, probably uncomfortable conversation. Just as quickly, our culture weakens and our bank account balance goes down.

Everyone on our team is accountable for adding to our cultural bank account. This is not to say that our balance will not go down. It will. We all make mistakes and none of us can be expected to perform perfectly. On balance, we should always be on the lookout for opportunities to push our culture in the direction of the culture we want.

Another way we work to increase our cultural balance sheet is by holding our coaches accountable for looking at our team holistically and identifying opportunities for increasing the balance on our cultural bank account. We expect them to coach everyone on our team about how to have those candid conversations. We expect them to hold us to our ideals. They will have candid conversations with you and they can coach you on how to have candid conversations.

### Changing our culture

On a quarterly basis we engage in a process to actively add to our cultural bank account. We discuss this in more detail later but we will touch on it briefly now. Every three months we all turn in to coaches for everyone with whom we worked in the previous three months.  We ask each person in Cotiviti Labs to think deeply about how the people with whom they worked can help us deliver more efficiently and effectively as a team. We are also looking for feedback on our culture.  What can we do to improve our culture? What can individuals do to better live our values?  Take this process seriously because we certainly do.

As you think about how we operate, you may find that there are certain aspects of our culture that are damaging to the results we are trying to achieve. We have had many moments like this since our inception, when we explicitly decided to make adjustments. Mind you, there is no need to wait until the end of the quarter to suggest a change, but our quarterly coaching process is the perfect time to stop and think.

You can create an issue against our culture just like you might create an issue against a piece of software. If there is something about it that isn't working well, identify it and ask for an improvement. There are bugs in culture just as there are bugs in software. Treating our culture as code means that we can think about it as an explicit thing that we architected, wrote, and implement. You can even create a pull request against our culture and suggest your own direct improvements.

## How we are organized

We are organized into four basic parts:

1. The first part, and the part to which we will have the most exposure, is the Network. The network is where all of the participants self-organize around big ideas and bring all their creative energy to bear to create innovative high quality products.

2. The second part, the Hierarchy, is where our administrative & operations partners work (e.g., finance, procurement, legal, and subject matter experts).

3. The third part is the Netarchy, where people in the hierarchy work with people in the network to solve some sort of specific business problem.

4. The fourth and final part is our Sponsors, comprised of executives and the occasional board member who provide guidance and counsel on where the Cotiviti Labs team can deliver the biggest impacts.

Let us address each of these parts in detail.

### Sponsors

We will start with the Sponsors because without them we do not exist. Sponsors are our executives, vice presidents, and sometimes board members.  Sponsors are responsible for setting the strategic direction for our entire team. Every project on which Labs works has a sponsor and you should know who that person is. If you do not know then ask.

Every week our team is responsible for producing [a report](https://github.com/cotiviti/LabsStatus/blob/master/README.md) that we deliver to our sponsors.  You should read this report and make sure that it is complete. This report our characterization of our progress and is critical for planning and setting expectations.

### Network

The Network is where great, high quality products are made. It is composed of people who have a deep passion for what they are doing. They are artisans, they are scientists, they are engineers, and they are tailors. What they do not have are titles. They do not have any reporting structure. They configure and reconfigure themselves to achieve the best outcomes based on their mix of skills, passions, and logistical considerations. Ideally, they have every skill necessary to achieve a solution as quickly and efficiently as possible. If they do not, they work with the coaching team to find a partner or attempt to recruit. In short, they are a fast moving unit that collectively makes objective decisions about how take out the dependencies to success.

### Netarchy

The Netarchy is a temporary organization where subject matter experts, consultants, vendors, and anyone else from outside the Network join for a limited period to achieve some objective. These individuals report to a hierarchy somewhere so their direct managers must carefully schedule their time. To this end, we set forth a few rules for the Netarchy:

1. Before someone from a Hierarchy joins the Netarchy, there must be explicit approval from that person's direct manager for time they will allocate to the Netarchy.

2. There must be an explicit agreement that the work that the person would normally be doing during their time in the Netarchy is either okay to delay or that someone else will pick up that work.

3. While they are in the Netarchy they play by Network rules. For example, nobody will report to them and they are accountable for delivering reliably to their partners in the Network. They will also participate in our quarterly coaching process.

4. Assignments in the Netarchy are temporary and last only for the duration of their responsibilities. Once those responsibilities are behind the team, everyone shakes hands as friends, and the individuals from the Hierarchy return to their assigned roles and work.

5. The entire team must be very sensitive to minimizing multi-tasking and instead maximize focus on finishing quickly and efficiently.

### Hierarchy

The Hierarchy is the traditional organization in which you will find those parts of the company typically responsible for administrative work like legal, procurement, and finance. No company can snap their fingers and transition to a fully networked company.  It may not even be a responsible thing to do.  So instead of fighting all hierarchy, we simply acknowledge that it is that and something we must work with.  Maybe that hierarchy will change to a network one day, maybe not.  Regardless, knowing how to work inside of a dual operatiing system with a Netarchy interface is important.

### What if I like hierarchy?

Our model isn't for everyone. Some people want a title, direct reports, and a boss. They want a corporate ladder to climb. These people play absolutely essential roles in the machinery required to run an effective business. As mentioned earlier, this hierarchical model is quite efficient for process heavy activity, like finance, procurement, and legal. For the creative work, we have found that a network is more effective and more efficient

In our team it is quite common for you to lead one day and then follow the next.  We are slaves to the results, not our title or presumed station.  We may decide that the amazing solution you built yesterday is a target for a [cleansing fire tomorrow](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cleansing-fire-chris-creel).  If you need more stability in your status, then this is probably not the team for you. If you come to such a conclusion, then we are happy to have played a part in your self-discovery. A lot of people never have the opportunity to really find out.

## What Cotiviti Labs produces

Everyone in Cotiviti is responsible for continuous improvement. It is there in our values and we hold ourselves accountable for making it happen. So what does Cotiviti Labs do, exactly? In short, Cotiviti Labs is responsible for finding, integrating, and building high quality creative solutions that strike at the heart of some huge vision to deliver break-through results that enable us to enter new markets, dramatically increase our profit margins, etc.

### Dual Use
Most of our initiatives have long strategic arcs. Achieving such results is always a hard, bloody knuckle, epic journey fraught with peril, failure, and tales of glory and tears. They also take way too long to achieve in the absence of some sort of interim deliverable that provides the company with some sort of substantial value. We think deeply about the journey we must undertake to achieve the big strategic result, but we also think about the waypoints along the way that can deliver interim value.

We have referred to this idea in various ways over time, but the one that seems to stick is "dual use." The philosophy is that we must deeply understand the dependencies between where we are and the Big Opportunity, and if there is some way to parlay an interim result into a solution that can deliver substantive value to the Sponsors, then we should do what we can to make that happen.  You can read more about this idea in [this blog](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pave-path-your-big-idea-value-chris-creel).

This often means that these interim solutions are quietly scheduled for slaughter as the rest of the strategic vision comes to life. As we have mentioned before, this is just a way of life for all contemporary technologies. Consider Hadoop MapReduce that burst on to the scene in 2009. A mere 5 years later Spark arrived and is now creatively destroying Hadoop MapReduce. Today 5 years seems like a lifetime. We could gnash our teeth and scream into the night but that would only blunt our competitive advantage. Better to acknowledge reality and become experts at increasing value and starting cleansing fires.

### Production solutions

The other thing the Cotiviti Labs team does is deliver creative, high quality, production ready solutions. This means that the solutions that come out of the Cotiviti Labs team are designed for the company to rely on day in and day out to generate value for our customers. We are then accountable for maintaining that solution moving forward and not handing it off to another "maintenance team."

This idea, that Cotiviti Labs does not hand stuff over has always been a bit controversial because it is counter to traditional ideas about R&D.The common argument is that the Cotiviti Labs team should only be focused on creating new things, not maintaining old things because we want to maximize the creative output from this team. We find a number of dangerous fallacies in this idea.

The first fallacy is that the quality and creativity of the original solution will not degrade were we to hand it over to another "less creative" team. In our experience the moment a solution is handed off to some other team who is expected to merely maintain it the solution begins to degrade.  This might be ok if the solution is slated for creative destruction or is simply at the end of its life because the business it supported has changed or evaporated.  If the solution is not at the end of its life then Cotiviti Labs will continue to maintain it with the highest levels of integrity and passion.

Another problem with handing over a solution to a maintenance team is that it implies some sort of stratification of talent, and therefore injects positional power with the obligatory class system and all of the evils therein.  Yes, there could be less experienced lower cost talent that could cut its teeth on maintaining a solution until it is slated for execution but these decisions should be made explicitly, transparently, and as an exercise in leveling up talent.

More troubling, however, is the idea that maintenance should be categorically less creative than building something new from scratch. Think about that for a moment. Imagine a world where a team is only accountable for creating new things and then throwing their results over the transom to some other team who then has to make it all work. Almost immediately, you can envision a rift between these two teams. The team that produced the "prototype" will take the position that their job is to create new stuff with exotic technologies. It is someone else's job to fix it when that exotic technology breaks in some weird way. Worse is that the people producing the initial solution are not incentivized to build a true production solution because, hey, what do they care; let that other team worry about the details.

While we have never seen any behavior this explicit, we did see calls from team members early in our evolution who didn't want to bother with the details of building a production solution. They just wanted to work on the "fun" stuff. The suggestion early on was that we break into a kind of caste system that would keep the creative people’s hands clean. Our industry has enough experience in software development by now to know that this kind of arrangement never leads to a high quality creative solution.

We believe that the better way, then, is to never throw anything over the transom. Give a mediocre idea over to a great team and they will make a great solution. Hand a great solution over to a mediocre team and only pain and misery will follow. So instead, we are responsible for building and maintaining our own solutions. If those solutions get too hard to maintain or too boring we will creatively destroy it with a cleansing fire and replace it with something that is easy and fun to maintain.

That is what will happen anyway when a great team is handed an aging, arthritic, ossified solution. They will burn it to the ground and build something better in its place. Companies like Netflix and Google do this all the time. Consider [Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard) from Netflix. This was at the core of their DevOps team. Then the team felt the pain of maintaining it, expanding on it to do new things, and leveraging new technologies. They decided to burn it to the ground and create [Spinnaker](http://www.spinnaker.io/).

### Operational Support

Another fallacy is that the Cotiviti Labs team should not take on the mantle of production infrastructure support. This idea stems from the days when infrastructure was physical and you needed arms and legs to receive, configure, and rack / stack servers, with all of the accompanying accouterments. Today, however, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), infrastructure is programmable. Therefore, we can no longer separate software from infrastructure; it is now all software.

This idea of programmable infrastructure is truly revolutionary. Where before infrastructure issues may be chalked up to manual process errors with programmable infrastructure issues are bugs and treated like any other defect. To this end, we write programs to provision and configure infrastructure – no humans needed.

## Who we are

So far, we have written about our culture and the importance we place on it.  We have written about our organizational structure. We have written about what we produce. What we have not written about yet is exactly who we are. What do we value as a team? This section covers this very topic in detail, so settle in.

### Our company values

Cotiviti has identified six company values it feels are critical to the overall health and productivity of the company. These are values that employees use to identify us to our customers, our markets, our partners, and our employees. Whenever a team is at a crossroads, they are encouraged to pull these values out and use them as a guiding principle. Truly, they are the defining characteristics for the broader company culture. While a lot of companies write down some values on a mouse pad and forget about them, Cotiviti uses them a working part of the company operating system. It is common to hear these values brought up in meetings or in one-on-one conversations (e.g., “the high integrity answer is…”or “the right thing for our customers is…”). In this section, we will cover each of the Cotiviti company values and explore what they mean to our team. These values appear in order of importance.

#### Integrity

Integrity is Cotiviti's number one, most important value. Being brutally honest with our customers, our sponsors, and each other is non-negotiable. No matter how painful it may be to admit a mistake or failure we must always maintain the highest standard of integrity and tell it like it is. Living this value on an R&D team can be bruising at times. Admitting that we completely screwed something up can be embarrassing and humiliating. However, the pain of the mistake is nothing compared to the pain of abandoning integrity even a little bit.

A controversial example is committing to dates.  This is perhaps the most common dysfunction in software development.  A manager, executive, or customer asks "when will it all be done?"  The software development team replies "two weeks."  Six weeks later they deliver.  As expectations go unmet, companies often implement heavier and heavier machinery to try and get accurate delivery dates.  Ironically, this machinery tends to make the team go even slower without delivering on the promised accuracy.

If everyone knows that a delivery date is probably bullshit then committing to it is a low integrity activity.  It is a white lie or a bald faced lie and niether is acceptable.  So what should we do instead?  We should work with our business partners to [identify valuable features that we can string together that add up to bigger and bigger deliveries](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pave-path-your-big-idea-value-chris-creel).  We should then do everything in our power to move as quickly as possible on delivering that value.  Finally, we should be fully transparent in our progress and let the sponsor decide if the return is threatened by the investment. You know... Agile development.

#### Our Customers

Our clients pay us for high quality, creative solutions that generate significant value that they simply cannot get anywhere else.  Without our customers we are nothing.  So, an interesting question might be, "Why aren't our clients first on the list?" The answer is that we will never do anything for our clients that compromises our integrity. That is how seriously we take integrity.

How does this manifest itself?  Our customers might ask us to do something that we know we can't do.  Instead of engaging in a transparent conversation about the challenges we could just say "sure, we can do" and hope that we figure it out later.  A lot of companies operate like this.  Not Cotiviti.  We will instead have that hard conversation even if it means we don't get the business.  We would rather have business we can service with high integrity than business we can't.  This is why 100% of our customers will serve as a reference. 

We could stop here and move on. Everyone can agree how important our customers are. Critical for each Cotiviti Labs person to ask is, “Who are **my** customers?” Equally important for each Cotiviti Labs person to ask is, "Am I someone's customer?" In a hierarchy, figuring out your customers is usually quite straightforward — one of your key customers is your boss, your boss's boss, and so on. By generating value to those that are in positions of power, you demonstrate your importance to the hierarchy. However, what if you don't have a boss? This gets a little more nuanced in a network, but have no fear; we have an easy way for you to figure it out.

Everyone in the Cotiviti Labs team produces value that others consume. We will cover this in a little more detail later on but for now, we will keep it simple. If you are working on a test, then your customer is the individual responsible for specifying the requirements for the test, typically the Solution Owner (aka, Subject Matter Expert or SME). Notice the dependency, though: the Solution Owner had to specify the requirements for the test in some manner, typically a user story. Before you started working on the test you were the customer and the Solution Owner was working for you!

This turn of events often befuddles people who have experience in industry. The Solution Owner is often treated as the customer, end of story. What if the Solution Owner produces crappy stories? To whom are they accountable? The answer in many companies is that they are accountable to nobody, leaving those responsible for developing solutions frustrated.

So when the Cotiviti Labs team says that customer focus is our second highest company value we mean that in a very holistic way. Each Cotiviti Labs member must be aware of the role they are playing in the moment, the deliverables they are expected to deliver when playing that role, and who their customers are. Your customer could be a teammate, it could be an executive, or it could be a paying customer.

So figure out who your customers are and be accountable to them for producing high quality, creative, high integrity solutions, be they user stories, tests, code, processes, or cultural changes. Also, figure out for whom you are a customer and hold those individuals accountable for similar results.

Here is an example of this from early on in our evolution when our team decided that it was time to get militant about test driven development (TDD). Every time we abandoned this idea it came back to bite us (painfully). Some of us bemoaned that the Solution Owner had not provided stories with enough clarity to write an objective test. Someone else piped up, "Well why didn't you hold them accountable for getting it right and telling them exactly what you needed?" The answer was confusion around the role of the Solution Owner. Weren't they in a position of power over the team, directing them what to do? How could the team challenge them?

This is a common and very damaging way of thinking in a networked team. Inside the network, we should always question and then crush any sign of positional power. It is amazing how often this dysfunction creeps in. Another example is behavior around the Cotiviti Labs Team Coach. It used to be when this person would arrive at one of our locations they would be given an office — a subtle cue that this person has positional power. People thought this individual had hiring / firing authority. What they missed is that this person has the most customers of all — the entire team! The Team Coach is accountable to the entire team for strengthening our culture, knocking down barriers, and looking for ways to make the team more efficient and effective. Inside the network, everyone has a critical role and there are no subordinates.

#### Our Team

Third on the list of Cotiviti's values is our team. In other words, supporting our team is critical to our success. What do we mean when we say that? Primarily it means strengthening our culture and each other; in other words adding to the balance of our cultural bank account and helping each other improve. It is not enough to live our values; you must also encourage other people on the team to do so. When you see someone behaving in a way that you believe weakens our culture, you must have the integrity and courage to have a candid conversation with them about it. In return, they should have the integrity to talk with you about it objectively and candidly. If that does not work then bring in a coach to help everyone involved think about how they can be more effective with such conversations.

By definition we hire very passionate people. That passion often translates into heated debates that, on the surface, look like fist fights in the making (virtual fist fights since we are scattered around the globe). We expect robust debates and we expect heated emotions. These kinds of exchanges are healthy as long as they are directed at the problem, strengthening our team, and delivering high integrity solutions to our customers. If the argument devolves into personal attacks we start debiting our cultural bank account and even more so if bystanders do not move to remedy the situation.

The other way we support our team is by reliably delivering results to our customers, who are often teammates. If you are playing the role of a customer (e.g., TestOps waiting on Solution Owner for requirements, Developer waiting on TestOps for tests, TestOps waiting on a Developer for a passing test, etc.), then hold your "vendor" accountable for reliably producing a high quality result.

An example comes from our early days when we were first starting to write user stories. People playing Developer went around and around with a Solution Owner about the quality and clarity of their stories. The process was insanely frustrating to watch. It was not unlike the exchanges between a web developer and users. Web developer: "Do you like this user interface?" User: "No." Web developer: “What should I change?” User: “I don’t know.” In this dysfunctional exchange the developer thinks that the Solution Owner is the customer when, in reality, it is the Developer that is the customer and the Solution Owner must be accountable to them for productive feedback.

The team finally settled on using a testing method that enabled the Solution Owner to describe their requirements in the form of a runnable test removing all ambiguity from the result. Now if the solution was not what the Solution Owner wanted, it was because they wrote a bad test. This creates a much healthier exchange where everyone is supporting each other in productive ways.

#### Accountability

Accountability is the next critical company value. For us being held accountable means that we start every bad outcome with "I." We have no victims on our team. When we stumble into a bad outcome we need to acknowledge our role in it, learn from the mistake, understand the dependencies that lead to it, and own it. This can be hard and can be made much worse in teams that lay blame and shame on those who were accountable for a result and failed. More often than not, there is a lot of accountability to go around, but few people think deeply about their specific line of accountability.

Deeply understanding lines of accountability require candid conversations with oneself and others that do not lay blame but, rather, work to identify and understand those lines. These lines are nothing more than dependencies, and as an R&D team we must be experts at identifying and understanding those dependencies.

#### Performance Excellence

While this is number five on the list, it is by no means less important than all of the others. Performance excellence includes:

* Bringing your "A" game each and every time to every single problem we work to solve and never settling for less than that
* Maintaining singular focus on creating high quality creative solutions to the exclusion of the many distractions we face each day.
* Knowing who your customers are and then reliably delivering to those customers.
* Being willing to push the panic button when you think our quality is slipping
* Hiring the very best and then supporting them
* Pushing for diversity to help us harden our ideas and to bring into perspective that to which we may be blind
* Using the highest quality open source projects and then contributing to them
* Open sourcing our own code so that we benefit from the bright light of transparency
* Coaching one another to level up our performance

In summary, performance excellence for the Cotiviti Labs team means establishing insanely high standards and then delivering above them whenever possible.

#### Continuous Improvement

The sixth and last company value is always working to improve ourselves, our team, our processes, etc. Our internal and external customers expect this from us, and so the Cotiviti Labs team uses four key examples for how we honor this value on the Cotiviti Labs team:

1. The first mechanism is our quarterly 360's coaching process. At the end of each quarter, we ask everyone to provide coaching advice to everyone on whom they depended for results during that quarter or who depended on them. The coaches then review these results along with each individual to help everyone become the very best whatever it is they are going to be.
2. The second mechanism is our culture as code mentality. We expect changes to our culture. We expect new versions or our culture. We expect everyone on the team to own these changes.
3. We also believe in event driven and/or quarterly blameless post-mortem's. These sessions enable us to review the frustrations channel, better practices channel, and any other ideas that may not have ended up in those channels but could help us go faster.
4. Our final continuous improvement mechanism is an annual team satisfaction survey. This survey helps us identify areas where we can improve more generally to increase morale.

### Our values

We are a small team inside a very big company. Our company has its own well-defined values that it uses regularly to help with decision-making. Think of those values like the physics in a gaming system. They are what hold us together and define us as a company.

In addition to our company values, we will define our specific team values. Think of these as the objects you might find in that gaming system that must comply with the physics set forth by our company values.

In this section, we will cover each of our specific team values in some detail and provide anecdotes to drive them home. This list is not complete, despite the length, nor is it in any particular order, unlike our company values. We expect this list will change over time as we grow and learn. For now this list is good enough, so let us get to it.

#### Quality

Quality is so critical to everything we do that it pervades every conversation. Our quality standards are insanely high and yet we believe they are not high enough. Why is quality so important? First quality is a reflection of our brand and that brand is defined first by integrity. When quality is baked into a culture that consistently produces high quality products and services for clients, those clients will give you the most valuable thing they have: their trust.

When you are a SaaS provider dealing with highly regulated data, trust is a precondition to every business transaction. Violating that trust because of quality issues will damage our brand, which can create a destructive cycle of stock devaluations, loss of trust with the Sponsors, increased oversight, and other measures that can be very hard to undo.

Dealing with quality issues is also not fun. Chasing bugs, dealing with poorly architected and poorly documented systems is a total drag. Dealing with angry clients is the absolute worst. All of the toxic side effects from poor quality solutions drive away talent to greener pastures where they can have more fun creating new things rather than struggling to fix old broken things.

High quality software is also the surest path to total creative freedom. Executives, board members, and stockholders do not care what you do or how you do it as long as the output is high quality solutions that delight customers and make them awesome. The minute quality issues begin cropping up is when everyone wants to get in on the action and has a "solution" that can “help.” This can quickly lead to a stifling environment that, again, is not any fun and hampers the degree of creative latitude we have. It results in status reports about quality metrics and consultants sent in to “help.”

Quality issues also lead to boredom of the worst kind. Large legacy systems with oodles of quality issues are just boring. You have to approach changes with extreme prejudice and careful planning, none of which anyone thinks is fun. Legacy systems that are high quality and easy to improve are a joy to work with. How many of those are there, though? Our team is here to create such systems for all the reasons we have written about so far, and so we do not get bored.

What does all this mean in practice? It means that our build system requires 95% test coverage. It means that we have zero tolerance for unhanded exceptions and exceptions in general except in truly exceptional circumstances, of which there are remarkably few. It means that we run linters on our code to identify bad coding practices that could threaten our quality. It means we run benchmarking tests on every single deployment. An underlying theme for all of these actions is the need for bots to ensure quality.

Humans are smart but error prone. Bots are stupid but do exactly what they are specified to do every single time. To help us achieve our quality goals we like to combine the best of both worlds. Where possible we use robots to automate any manual work that can be automated. We also use bots to review our work to help us identify problems. We would rather stop, no matter how critical the task, and build a bot to help us improve our quality, if possible, rather than risk our quality by going it alone without a robot. That is how serious we are about quality. You can read more about [this idea here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-one-welcome-our-new-robot-overlords-chris-creel).

#### Passion

We expect everyone who joins our team to have passion about something that can help accelerate us. It can be passion about anything as long as the group believes that it is something that largely complements us or strengthens us where necessary. Valve Corporation refers to this kind of person as the ["T-shaped" employee](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf). This is a good metaphor in that it nicely summarizes the idea that we want people to be generally good across the board (horizontally) but also have some special area of interest that makes them uniquely interesting to us (vertically). Examples might include security, cluster computing, beautiful usable interfaces, quality, etc.

We have passed over many candidates who looked great on paper. When we talked to them they were generally good candidates. They probably passed our coding test with aplomb. Yet, when we asked them about what their passion really is, they fell silent. We rely on a person's particular area of passion to get to that next level of greatness. We rely on it to help our networked team better self-organize. Without some particular area of passion, candidates will always be at a disadvantage on our team and we just cannot afford that.

Critical to our success is that each member of the team knows the passions of each of the other members of the team. If you are new to the team, take a moment to introduce yourself in the on-boarding channel so that your new team knows how best to use you. This information can also help when we are searching for a way forward out of a sticky situation. You never need permission to take responsibility—if you think you have a passion for solving some seemingly intractable problem, speak up and take responsibility. If you know that someone else has a passion about something that can help us move forward, feel free to volunteer them; we do it all the time.

Passion is not always immutable and durable. Some people come to a place in their life where the thing that got them excited yesterday has become a chore today. There is no shame in this. Instead, embrace it. We have many opportunities to get excited about. Create your own ending.

#### Humility

Let's start with the definition of humility.

humility |(h)yo͞oˈmilitē|
noun
a modest or low view of one's own importance; humbleness.
ORIGIN Middle English: from Old French humilite, from Latin humilitas, from humilis.

So, why is humility so important to our team? Why is it so important that we keep our own egos in check? Because when you hire a bunch of smart people they can quickly turn into total jerks!

There is a great book by a renowned Stanford business school professor called [*The No Asshole Rule*](http://a.co/2ma3cL1). The premise is simple: Do not ever hire a jerk! The book posits that an arrogant bully is less effective than a more modest person even if the modest person is less capable. How can this be? The reason is as simple as the premise: people will tend to avoid the jerk thereby reducing the amount of value they bring to the organization. The more modest person, being more approachable, will have a broader, positive impact.

Arrogance hurts us in other ways. People who have an overblown view of their abilities tend to blind themselves with their own bullshit. They will ignore critical dependencies, assuming that they will be "no big deal," only to discover later that the challenges the team faced were much bigger than their actual skills could overcome. Think about the number of times you personally said something like: "That shouldn't be a big deal. I'll be done in a few days." Weeks later and without a solution the team is demoralized, beaten down, and exhausted from trying to cash the check you wrote. This kind of intellectual arrogance is all too common and it is everyone's responsibly to train their ear for it and attack it with malice when it appears.

We keep intellectual arrogance in check by challenging everyone on all of the dependencies that stand between success and us. We approach this process with humility and objectivity. None of us wants to be stuck in a situation where our arrogance blinds us to our dependencies and plunges us into a grueling dog fight for weeks or even months on end.

We often talk about accelerating risk. What does that mean? More often than not, risks are unseen dependencies or work items that have many transitive dependencies. Therefore, in the end, risk can largely be defined as the number and complexity of the dependencies that require clearing on the way to success.

Yet another way arrogance hurts us is when we refuse to collaborate because "everyone else sucks." This kind of arrogance puts the entire team at risk. First, it will lock one person into one part of the solution, making it their territory. Over time there is only so much territory that one person can handle, and eventually they run out of capacity to work on other things. Second, it blocks that person's talents from the rest of the team; assuming they really are awesome, then that awesomeness will remain isolated. Finally, it puts everyone at risk because everyone is temporary. We cannot ever forget that.

Then there is the more insidious "That's not my job. Let the <insert role here> handle that." This kind of attitude creates a class system and complementary positional power that immediately handicaps teams. Note that it is perfectly okay to say "I'm terrible at that but you know who is great is &lt;name person here&gt;."

#### Fun

Ed Catmull, CEO of Pixar, once said that the best way to measure a team is not by their output but by the "spirit in the room." His thinking, as is ours, is that if you hire great people who are deeply passionate about delivering high quality creative solutions then you don't have to worry about them delivering solutions because you basically get that for free. They will produce because it is who they are. What is left, then, is ensuring that they have fun delivering great results.

This is perhaps one of the easiest things to screw up with a creative team. Damaging morale is incredibly easy with any team but this is especially true with passionate creative teams. One misplaced comment spawned from a moment of frustration can immediately destroy morale, and there is little you can do to un-ring that bell. Emotions often run high where passionate people argue, so we must always be on the lookout for criticisms that drift away from the problem and towards individuals.

Harder is ensuring that people are taking care of themselves and are not feeling the burn of working too hard. When Ed Catmull talks about the "spirit in the room" he refers to a gaming company that shoots for a 15% attrition rate. Their mentality is that employee productivity shoots up when they first join but then begins to wane as they burn out. After they burn out, they become expendable, falling into the 15% attrition rate. Think about that for a moment and contemplate what the "spirit in the room" must be at such companies. Think about how miserable it must be for a person after their enthusiastic arc of peaks begins to wane and they begin grinding down into burnout and another job.

Forget about what your résumé says. Who wants to live like that when you do not have to? We certainly do not want to live like that in Cotiviti Labs. We encourage everyone to have fun. It is okay to joke, share your personal stories, go out to bars and have a beer when you can, play console games with one another, and so on. If you enjoy one another and have fun, great work will follow. That is what happens when you hire people passionate about producing high quality creative results.

Something else that can suck the fun from the room is boredom. It happens to the best of us. One way to get there is that we are wildly successful and we build something that everyone loves and now we become tethered to it forever. Over time, you may slowly grow to hate your creation. The worst-case scenario for the team is for you to quit just to get away from your creation! So what we do? We start a cleansing fire and burn your precious solution to the ground is what we do.

The Cleansing Fire is our way of innovating our way out of boredom. Almost every solution can benefit from the Cleansing Fire. New technologies can make any solution more powerful, new architectural patterns can reduce maintenance, and fresh eyes can see better solutions. This technique is so important to us that we often use new team members to start a Cleansing Fire for any part of our solution that we have grown to hate. You can read more about [cleansing fires here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cleansing-fire-chris-creel).

"We don't have the resources to do that," some will say. Our retort is that we risk losing resources if we do not start the fire. "It will take too much time," others will say. Our retort is that we architected our solution in a way that enables us to incrementally burn it to the ground. If we cannot acknowledge that we should burn something for the good of our customers, sponsors, and investors then we face an ever-growing mountain of technical debt. All this is to say that we should never be afraid of setting a Cleansing Fire as a way to make a boring problem fun.

Another way to boredom is to be good at a role in which you have lost interest. Maybe you have been playing developer but you have a great idea and now you want to switch to Solution Owner. Maybe you have been playing TestOps and are awesome at it but you have also grown bored and want switch to development for a while. We encourage this kind of role shifting. We do not ever want lackluster performance. Moreover, if you are feeling trapped and ready to pursue opportunities with another company we would rather you just quit to another role than quit to another company. We will figure it out as a group and adjust.

Not everything we do is super cool and cutting edge. We will always have to deal with incremental feature enhancements, bug fixes, upgrades, and the like. There will be times when there is nothing new to build but instead an off-the-shelf solution that we need to configure. There will be messes that others create that we need to help clean up.

If this is all we did, it would get pretty boring fast. However, there is a lot of money to be made in solving boring problems. So we encourage you to solve boring problems in interesting ways. Ask yourself if there is a way to make some boring task more interesting. If there is, talk with the team about it, and then make it happen.

Of course, a lot of companies lock themselves in to a moment from the distant past with legacy solutions. Even though there is a better way to solve that problem, keeping the legacy solution fed is a full time job. We will find ourselves in this situation as well. When this happens we need to attempt to reorganize ourselves to free up the required capacity or hire a new person to give us more capacity.


#### Candor

Candor is perhaps one of the hardest things for any team but especially a team scattered around the globe whose primary forms of communication are chat, pull-request comments, and video conferencing. We all want to be liked; well most of us want to be liked (we have a few odd exceptions). We do not want to hurt each other’s feelings. These very human emotions often blunt our honesty. When we think someone's solution is crap, instead of having that candid conversation we bite our tongue. When we see that someone is invested in a solution that may be misplaced, we find it difficult to get into a debate with them.

The cold stark reality is that anyone who works on something for any length of time becomes personally and emotionally invested in it and finds it difficult to separate themselves from their work. When someone criticizes the work, the creator cannot get out of the way and feels like the criticism is instead directed at them and not their work. Consequently, honest debate about the best way forward fizzles. The value in the diversity we hire for is blunted. We confuse a desire for all of us to get along with not engaging in the difficult conversations about the best way forward.

Our going-in position is that everything we do can be improved. In order to stay true to our continuous improvement value, we must be worse off today than we will be tomorrow. In this context, pointing out our state of affairs is not helpful. We already know we can do better. The more productive path forward is to help the group brainstorm better practices so that we really are better tomorrow than we are today.

Candor can also mean being the sole dissenting opinion on how to proceed. We hire smart, talented people so if any of them has a dissenting opinion we should stop and really think about it because dissenting opinion requires candor and sometimes courage. Never shy away from being the lone dissenting opinion.

We have several mechanisms to help you have these candid conversations, including:

* First and foremost, the most powerful elixir for great candid conversations is humor about the issue. We value it deeply. Well-placed humor takes the edge off the conversation and directs people towards the issue and not the person.
* Our quarterly coaching process provides a great opportunity to stop and think deeply about how you and your colleagues can improve. Be candid, be empathetic, and give your colleagues candid feedback.
* If the conversation is about an individual, then the best method is always in person first, then video conferencing if an in person conversation isn’t possible. These conversations require the full spectrum of information conveyed through facial expressions and body language.
* If you aren't sure how to proceed, grab a coach and ask for advice.

Debating candidly takes a lot of energy for some people. Others savor the fight. If you are one of those people who savor the fight, recognize that the person with whom you are debating may not like confrontation. Bullying them into submission won't help anyone. Instead recognize that you have a passion for debating and coach the other person to draw them out so that you fully understand their point of view.

Finally, always end a candid debate with a concrete way forward and a plan for how to do it. If you walk away from a debate about the best path forward without a concrete plan, then you just wasted everyone’s time. At a minimum if you run out of time make it a point to put time on the calendar to get back together and create the concrete plan. When you have that plan make sure that everyone that it affects knows about it. Surprises can cause irritation and resentment, and thereby interfere with the efficiency of the team.

#### Fearless

Fear is awesome when you are about to be attacked by a tiger. We have team members who live in places with tigers and we totally encourage them to be fearful should they run into one. Fear is Mother Nature's way of putting us on autopilot and warp speed when she thinks we are in physical danger. She spent 4 billion years programming us and she is not going to let us screw that up by overthinking the moment. She is going to shift you into flight mode and worry about the wisdom of that decision later. That is about where the value of fear ends.

We are writing software and policy, not defending ourselves from jungle cats, so we should behave accordingly. We are in research and development. Anyone who has been in R&D long enough knows that the 'R' really means "lots of failure" and the 'D' mean, "we figured out all of the ways to not do it." The objective is to be wrong as fast and as cheaply as possible in order to get to a working solution.

One of our key methods for doing this is by exploring all of the dependencies between where we are and where we need to be and then experimenting as quickly as possible to clear away the dependencies as efficiently and effectively as possible. We came to this approach after many years of the alternative—time driven development in its many forms (Scrum Agile, Waterfall, Spiral, etc.), all of which generate fear.

What all these time based approaches share are bad estimates. **People are simply awful at estimating time to complete a creative task.** The reason is that they do not know about all of the dependencies. They might think something will take two weeks until they stumble on an integration dependency they had not thought about ahead of time. This is often compounded by intellectual arrogance that blinds people to assumptions they are making about dependencies. Only when people have thought through all of the dependencies and have cleared dependencies exactly like them before will they have a chance at producing an accurate time estimate.

So, what happens when people miss their deadlines? They become fearful that they will get fired, get in trouble, be humiliated, or that their project will be shut down. In response, they take short cuts. They exchange technical debt for inaccurate estimates. Many times, they do this unconsciously but sometimes they do it consciously, telling themselves they will pay that debt later, only increasing their anxiety. Meanwhile, emotions like fear and anxiety modulate your emotions, cloud your thinking, and create fertile ground for bad decisions. You may find more information [on this topic here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-am-terrible-estimating-time-chris-creel).

Research and development is stressful business. Failure is a necessary part of the process and it would be foolish to think that we can disconnect ourselves from the emotional roller coaster of that experimentation process. Think about how many times you have felt elation from believing that you had fixed that nasty memory leak—and then feeling your heart sink when you saw the heap creeping back up. Those emotions do not help you think clearly about the dependencies and experiments you need to complete in order to clear them.

We all need to keep our emotions in check so they do not cloud our thinking. We also need to support each other and be empathetic to what others are going through. If you see them fraying around the edges, say something to them or ask a coach for counsel.

In order to clear dependencies as quickly and effectively as possible we need objective assessments based on data and not raw emotion. So, keep your fear in check and support your team members to keep their fears in check.

#### Efficiency

Our primary currency with our sponsors is speed. Markets move faster than they ever have before and this acceleration is only intensifying. Cotiviti Labs is a key weapon in going after new opportunities or responding to emerging threats in our fast changing reality. Consequently, efficiency is one of our top priorities and something we value. Producing solutions is what our sponsors value most, not administrative overhead or wasteful activities that could otherwise be eliminated or automated.

What does efficiency mean, exactly? To us efficiency means making every minute count while we are working to achieve the business goals we are given. We mean this quite literally. Every single day ask yourself – “is what I am doing right now going to deliver business value in the most efficient manner possible?” Are there ways that you can break the work down in such a way that you can recruit team members to help you clear dependencies most expeditiously?

There is more to efficiency than just clearing dependencies quickly or delivering client value faster. Efficiency is also our primary weapon against boredom. Nobody wants to be stuck with any task longer than is necessary. Eventually you will grow tired of it and want to move on to something new. Efficiency is a key mechanism for us to do just that—get tasks behind us quickly so we can get on to new challenges.

To help us with our efficiency we measure the velocity of each project every day and post that measurement in our communication channels.  This is a relative number unique to the project but it does give us a metric we can discuss.  For example:

* Is the metric going up?
** Why is that?
** Did we mean for that to happen?
** Is there a way for us to strengthen the effect?
* Is the metric going down?
** Did we expect that to happen?
** Is there a way we can course correct?
** Do we have the right skills?

#### Creativity

Our sponsors and our customers (both internal and external) expect high quality and creative solutions. It is no surprise that we value creativity in all its various forms. All too often companies fall prey to their own inertia. Why do something creative to achieve a breakout result when doing it the way we have always done it is so much easier? There are many good reasons why, so let us start with the obvious.

We believe that we should create our own most fierce competitor before the market does it for us. No idea is sacred; all ideas are subject to creative destruction. The minute you think otherwise is the minute that a kid at MIT is thinking about how to creatively destroy your business. So we are constantly looking for ways to creatively super-cede our current incarnation.

Creativity is also crucial because, frankly, the vast majority of the problems we try to solve with software are mind-numbingly boring. Invoicing, contract compliance, and supply chain management are seemingly boring compared to video games and apps. However, there is tremendous value in solving boring problems in creative ways. Think about your favorite Silicon Valley darlings of the moment—they did just that. Uber is a taxi service. Apple is a hardware company. Google is an advertising company. Each of these companies brought tremendous creativity to tremendously boring market segments.

We are no different. On the surface, our problems may appear dry and boring. We could bring dry and boring solutions to the market that would fade into the background and leave our customers bored. That is not how we roll. Instead, we intersect innovative technologies, super smart people, and global perspectives to make our boring problems intensely interesting.

Creativity, by the way, does not equal complexity. In fact, we value just the opposite: creatively simple solutions. Often where we see complexity is exactly where we will point our creative destruction weaponry. For it is in complexity that competitors often find weakness and opportunity. Consider the Blackberry versus the iPhone. The iPhone was a remarkably simpler device to use. While Blackberry averted their eyes from their own creative destruction, the minute the iPhone came out, almost everyone looked at it and fell in love with its simplicity.

We actively seek out people who are passionately creative in some way that will accelerate us and help us create higher quality, more creative solutions. Our global diversity is a big factor in our creative capabilities. Our networked structure also lends itself to greater creativity by giving everyone an opportunity to innovate in whatever direction strikes them as most promising. Another way we try to increase our creative edge is by maximizing fresh eyes joining our team.

Every new person on our team gets a coach who is responsible for integrating them into the team and helping them identify areas they can focus on to demonstrate themselves to the group. We typically ask new people to look at old problems to get their fresh perspective. In fact we believe that this vector of value for a new person drops quickly as they become accustomed to our methods and our code because soon enough their new perspective becomes legacy.

#### Acceptance & Sensitivity

As we mentioned earlier we deeply value diversity. We value different points of view, cultures, backgrounds, industry experience, genders, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and the list goes on. Research shows that diversity makes for smarter, more creative teams. Our own experience plays this out, too. We have occasionally seen additional value in a candidate specifically because they will serve as a counter-balance to another person on the team.

We are all a little weird in one way or another. Once you hit a certain IQ you often get a little weirder (you know who you are). We all have our eccentricities be they learned or genetic. However, everyone on our team got here through hard work, passion, and getting through our admittedly grueling interview process and so everyone deserves respect. Consequently, we all need to accommodate each other’s humanity.

We also need to accept each other’s mode of working. Some of us are sprinters—we run like hell for a few days, then fall over panting for a few days. Some of us are night owls and some of us are early risers. We have people in time zones that span across Pacific Time to India Standard Time and everything in between —a little more than half the planet. In the end, we need to evaluate each other by the quality and volume of the work and not how it gets done.

Finally, we need to respect each other’s methods. If someone decides to go off in a direction you do not agree with, give them some latitude. Actively seek their perspective. They will probably surprise you. If they fall into a pit of alligators, then they will have learned a lesson better than you could have ever taught them.

#### Confidentiality

Everything we do in Cotiviti Labs is confidential. Reasons why include:

1. We are going to fail. Failing can be stressful and occasionally embarrassing. We need to create an environment where it is safe to fail and fail fast. The only people who need to know about that failure are your team members and our Sponsors.

2. We are going to be successful. When that happens, there is a good chance that it will displace or replace some existing solution from which someone else may have made a career. That person does not need the stress of knowing that their world might change dramatically, the operative word being “might.” If we are successful then we will put together a transition plan designed to keep the stress from change low. If we fail then nobody would have benefitted from worrying about it in the first place.

3. What we work on is cool and sometimes scary. We often work with powerful, innovative technologies in order to solve the toughest problems. Those can be fun to talk about but they can also be a huge distraction. Suddenly people might feel pressure to go study up on some topic and try to use it. Again, everything we use “might” solve some pressing business problem. Until we actually solve the problem, nobody needs to know about the research.

4. We need our fellow employees to be laser focused on their jobs without distractions. Our colleague’s success pays for our research & development. If we distract them, we put our own work at risk. Instead, thank them and cheer them on. We need them to be successful and they need us to be successful.

5. We do not want to telegraph our direction to anyone who might share it with a customer or competitor. We do not need customers putting pressure on us for things that are half-baked, forcing us to take short cuts and undermine quality. We also do not need competitors blunting our competitive edge.

The only exception to these rules is this: if any Sponsor, described in detail below, asks you a question, feel free to answer it thoroughly. If you have any questions about this feel free to ask a coach.

### Role descriptions

You have a passion for something we thought was cool and you thought we could give you the creative freedom to do it a lot and so here you are. However, we do a lot of cool stuff and passions change. We are okay with that and it is why our roles are not static. You can choose to take on a new role or project whenever you think it is necessary to help us go faster or to rejuvenate yourself. You may develop code, build testing bots, spec out new solutions, etc.

So why do we define roles at all? Simply put we need organizational specificity in order to hold each other accountable for those things we commit to delivering. We have been at this software game long enough to generally know what the high level roles are, what they produce, and to whom they are accountable and for what.

That means you need to know the role each person on your team is playing at any given moment and then hold him or her accountable for their commitments. We like everyone to be singularly focused on delivering amazing results, one at a time. We appreciate that we do a lot of cool stuff and you may want to work on everything. Unfortunately, everyone is terrible at multi-tasking (yes, even you) so we also use roles to create focus and make it easy for everyone else to help you stay focused.

In keeping with our eschewing positional power, no role is any more important than any other role. There are not any other roles that "report" to other roles. All roles are equally important and are part of the Cotiviti Labs eco-system. A lot of people become confused by this. They think that Developers report to Solution Owners, DevOps reports to Developers, everyone reports to Coaches, and so forth. This way of thinking is corrosive to our method so you need to put this out of your mind completely and instead think in terms of who is accountable for what and to whom. Said another way, think of our team as an accountability network. In this section, we will describe what each person is accountable for and to whom.

#### Coach

Coaches are here to help us become the very best team possible. You can think about them like a literal sports coach on a sports team. Think about how sports coaches operate. We will use American Football as our metaphor. The team assembles on the sideline, the coach gives them advice on how to score on the other team, and in the end everyone but the coach goes out on the field. More often than not, the other team does something unexpected and the team decides on the fly that the situation has changed and the advice, provided only seconds before, is no longer appropriate.

When you are working with a creative team, especially a global creative team, you are in a very similar situation. When you actually go to score a point the coach probably is not around and in fact might be asleep. The advice proffered by the coach may become immediately irrelevant the moment you try to execute on the advice because you run into some unforeseen circumstance.

Coaches are here to serve as mentors, facilitators, and organizational optimizers. Coaches bring many years of experience working with large organizations across many different functions. They bring stories of successes but they also bring stories of failures. They can cite example after example of why they believe something will work out one way and not the other. While they bring counsel and advice, they have no authority to direct the team in one way or the other but instead bring sage counsel. You can choose to listen to their advice and then ignore it.

Coaches embody our values and our culture and help push us towards a place where we can truly enjoy our work and produce the most creative value for our customers. They regularly take stock of where we can optimize our team to have even more fun and produce even greater results. We also expect them to be leaders in their industry giving them unique insight into where we are and where we are going. Coaches can also facilitate conversations. You can ask them to bring their experience to any conversation that could help the members of the team navigate themselves to a solution everyone can agree on.

You should expect a level of candor from our coaches that may be uncomfortable at first. Remember that we value candor from everyone but we expect coaches to hold us all accountable for being candid and that may feel abrupt at times. Also remember that you are not your code or your solutions and you are not a problem we are trying to solve. We will not attack each other but we will attack our proposed solutions mercilessly.

Coaches are also the only people outside of each individual team member who have access to all of the quarterly coaching results. They read all of the results holistically, looking for weaknesses and strengths across the team that can complement one another to help us become more cohesive. Each quarter they come up with improvement plans that they hold themselves accountable for executing. They will also sit down with you to talk about your own results and help you think about what you should focus on in the months ahead. Their advice is just that — advice. You can choose to listen to or ignore that advice.

Coaches are also accountable for refereeing debates that are not progressing towards a productive conclusion. The team can bring them in to make a call but then everyone is responsible for accepting that answer and moving forward.

Here are some things the coaches explicitly do not do:

* Assign work. Work assignment is up to each individual. Coaches might make suggestions but ultimately it is the individual who must decide if they would have fun with a particular piece of work and can deliver outstanding results.
* Coaches do not perform the typical "annual review" that a manager might provide. They will help you think about your quarterly feedback from your peers but that is the full extent of it.
* Coaches do not decide on your annual merit increases.  We have a formal process that leverages input from the team and performance against standard goals.  You can read more about [this process here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-know-kung-fu-chris-creel).
* They do not exert firing power. If we need to terminate someone's employment because of poor quarterly coaching scores, the coach is accountable for honoring the math and nothing more.
* They do not have hiring authority.  Hiring decisions are made by the team.  Coaches will provide input to the process but that input has equal weight to all other input.

Some readers may ask "what is the different between a coach and a great manager?"  The answer is simple - successful coaches are eventually not needed at all.

#### Application Developer

Application Developer’s are accountable for delivering high quality, well-architected, well-documented software that satisfies tests defined by people playing the TestOps role and, by extension, the user stories defined by people playing the Solution Owner Role. Developers are also accountable to DevOps for understanding the rules, policies, and tooling they need to use in order to get the software into production. Furthermore, they are accountable to DevOps for specifying infrastructure needs with sufficient detail so that a robot can implement it.

#### Policy Developers

Policy Developers are responsible for delivering high quality policy for our customers. They do this with the software solutions developed by their team members.  So developing high quality policy also means working with their team members to create solutions that facilitate the process. Think of Policy Developers as captive users of the solutions we build.

#### Operations Developers

Operations Developers (DevOps) are accountable to the team for enterprise automation in all ways including things like automated build & deploy, infrastructure construction, quality checks, etc. They are also accountable for reproducibility, reliability, and determinism. Essentially this is a development role similar to the Dev role but the programs they write provision and configure servers, automate processes, etc.

#### Solution Owner

The overarching goal for the Solution Owner is to represent the voice of the customer and to help everyone else understand that voice. He or she is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to our business partners and customers. One way of doing this is writing User Stories that describe bite-sized chunks of business value, prioritizes them, and adds them to the risk pool (described below). Another way is writing documents (e.g., Wiki's, User Stories) to get everyone on the same page (pun intended). Sometimes the Solution Owner will build a prototype that can serve as another input into the development process. Mostly they just spend a lot of time researching and talking to the rest of the team to help them understand the problem and the risks involved.

This person has deep experience with the problem domain and understands it down to the atomic level. Just as important, this person is also an excellent teacher—able to find ways to help the rest of the team understand the problems they need to solve and the business risks they need to mitigate. They write great documentation, are able to jump on video calls at a moments notice, and are patient.

#### Sponsor

Sponsors can be customers, executives, board members, or anyone else who has a stake in the success of some solution that the different focus areas are working to deliver. These individuals often work with the Solution Owners, Product Line Owner, and Coaches. Occasionally they will attend demos. Solution Owners work with Sponsors to come up with ideas that then become focus areas. For instance, our Chief Operating Officer, Dave Beaulieu has driven a number of these kinds of ideas including our work around the Drugs & Biological’s Cultivation Platform and the NexGen Adjudication Engine.

As discussed previously, we meet with our Sponsors every quarter to discuss our lessons learned and to plan for the next three months. Sponsors are typically accountable for business strategy with insight into where our company needs competitive advantages. They all have say over research and development spending and therefore have a keen interest in what our team is doing and how we are spending the company's money. The permanent Sponsors are our CIO, CEO, COO, and CFO. Board members can also join our Sponsor meetings on occasion.

# It isn't code!

Yes, you had to wait until the end for us to say it out loud. Humans are messy, confused, eccentric, creatures who are irrational at times. Code is clean, logical, deterministic, and never does anything irrational (yes, we could debate this, but it isn't happy hour yet). Mother nature spent 4 billion years programming us for every eventuality that has occurred during that time. We are filled with tics and behaviors that kept us alive one million years ago but make little sense now (EEK! SPIDER!!!). All that being said, our goal here is to create a culture that attracts people just like you. Apparently we were successful because, well, here you are reading this.

Humans aren't computers and this document isn't a legal writ. We can only hope that it helps you frame your thinking and provides a guiding light when we are wading in murky waters. If we find that aspects of this document aren't helpful, then let's change it. But, like democracy, we believe that the approach laid out here is the best worst option, to steal a phrase from Winston Churchill.

So why did we wait for the very end to tell you that culture isn’t exactly code? For the same reason Van Halen used to demand that their backstage room have a bowl filled with M&M's 

# Acknowledgements
Innovation is rarely, if ever, the act of conjuring a completely novel idea from a vacuum. Most if not all ideas come from a blender of existing ideas that are a few minutes old to thousands of years old. We openly embrace this reality, and this handbook is a culmination of many such ideas. In this section we do our best to acknowledge the most obvious ones. In reality, if we were able to acknowledge every single inspiration for what you've read in this handbook, it would likely wrap around the globe many times over.
